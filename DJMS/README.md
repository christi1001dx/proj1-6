##**2. The Vision**

       Our group plans to create Storyinator, a code that will allow on-going stories to be written. 
       The home directory will be a login page.
       There will be a page that lists all the stories that have been created, and any user can click and read those stories.
       Registered (and logged-in) users will be able to add on to those stories, and are even given the ability to delete 
       stories if they see fit.
       There will be a my_stories page that will list all the stories that have been worked on (i.e. started/edited) by 
       that user.


##**3. Timeline**

       Our timeline is still undecided
