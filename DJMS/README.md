_The Vision_

Our group plans to create Storyinator, a code that will allow on-going stories to be written. The home directory will list all the stories that have been created, and any user can click and read those stories. Registered (and logged-in) users will be able to add on to those stories, and are even given the ability to delete stories if they see fit.
