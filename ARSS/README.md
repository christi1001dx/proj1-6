Project Description
===================

Storyinator will allow for a large number of stories from different users.  Users will be able to post a new line in the story either when logged in or anonymously, although anonymous users won't be able to contribute to certain stories, at the discretion of the user who created the story originally.  The information will be stored in a MongoDB.  

All users will initially arrive at a homepage with a list of all the stories in the database.  They will be able to login, register, or sort/filter the list of stories.  They can then click on a story and add their own lines to that story.
