You need to have mongo installed to run this. 

If you don't have mongo
pip install pymongo
and
install mongo through a package manager of your choice

And then before running jaspar.test blah blah .py in different terminal window run mongod

This exists due to Jason's incompitence; he didn't understand that mongo was needed.
